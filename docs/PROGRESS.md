# Current progress

Public demonstration: https://careathome-platform.vercel.app. Private source: haseeb9876/careathome-platform. Vercel automatically deploys master. No Docker.

## Cleanup release

Removed retired Supabase configuration, migrations, scripts and integration suites from the active tree; their history remains in Git. Applied Neon migrations 000-009 are unchanged. Removed the unused application pool, superseded upload action, duplicate visual capture tool, obsolete matrix generator and unused Nodemailer packages.

Split dashboard rendering into fourteen named screen modules with an explicit role registry. Extracted action validation/procedure definitions from server action execution. Split the global stylesheet into six ordered stylesheets; parsed CSS rules and declaration order were checked to be identical. Private local environment, backup and SRS files are preserved.

The maintenance guide describes ownership, setup, migrations, verification and deployment. Static checks, zero-warning lint, 33 unit tests, optimized build and 59 Neon workflows pass. Twelve of thirteen Chrome scenarios passed across local runs; administrator access passed on retry. Cleanup commit 0ffc743 is deployed and GitHub CI passed. The 5 MiB storage transfer remains blocked by observed timeouts/Neon HTTP 500 responses; the browser now stops after 90 seconds and offers retry guidance. All five hosted role/report/accessibility scenarios passed. See TEST_RESULTS.md for detailed evidence. The next priority is isolating and resolving the large-object storage failure before claiming full upload acceptance.

## Existing verified functionality

The previous release passed 13 hosted Chrome scenarios plus receipt PDF export, 59 Neon care-workflow checks, 18 foundation checks, 8 HTTP auth scenarios, 3 recovery checks, 6 private storage scenarios and 33 unit tests. Those results predate the current refactor and are regression baselines.

## Remaining product/service work

External email transport, scheduled backups, broader performance/browser/accessibility acceptance and the conditional/deferred SRS features remain open. Payments are simulated and summaries deterministic. The phrase "other app" still needs a project name/path before work can begin in another repository.
